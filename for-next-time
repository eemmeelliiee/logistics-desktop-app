 Innehåller Shipment CRUD-function ??? (samt resterande klasser)
1. Kontrollera toString()
    vad ska return en toString? getShipemtLogs ???
2. Fortsätt med funktioner för alla klasser
3. Kolla upp error handling

4. When shipment.getShipmentLogs.toString() is called (on shipment) it should return a list of shipment logs and EXCLUDE shipmentID
5. When warehouse.getShipmentLogs.toString() is called (on warehouse) it should return a list of shipment logs and EXCLUDE warehouse name

HUR:
if the inspectionentry is the only inspection, set inspected to false
public void removeInspection(InspectionLog inspection) {
    if (inspection.getShipment().getInspected()) {
        inspectionsMade.remove(inspection);
        System.out.println("Inspection removed from shipment " + inspection.getShipment().getShipmentId());
    }
    System.out.println("Shipment has not been inspected yet");

}
